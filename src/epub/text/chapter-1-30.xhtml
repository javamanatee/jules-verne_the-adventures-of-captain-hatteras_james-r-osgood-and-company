			<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>
			<h4>THE CAIRN.</h4>
			<p>This phenomenon, which is peculiar to the polar regions, had lasted three quarters of an hour; the bears and foxes had had plenty of time; these provisions arrived opportunely for these animals, who were nearly starved during the inclement weather; the canvas cover of the sledge was torn by their strong claws, the casks of pemmican were opened and emptied; the biscuit-sacks pillaged, the tea spilled over the snow, a barrel of alcohol torn open and its contents lost, their camping materials scattered and damaged, bore witness to the ferocity of these wild beasts, and their greediness.</p>
			<p>“This is a misfortune,” said Bell, gazing at this scene of ruin.</p>
			<p>“Which is probably irreparable,” said Simpson.</p>
			<p>“Let us first estimate the loss,” interrupted the doctor, “and we’ll talk about it afterwards.”</p>
			<p>Hatteras, without saying a word, began to gather the scattered boxes and sacks; they collected the pemmican and biscuits which could be eaten; the loss of part of their alcohol was much to be regretted; for if that was gone there would be nothing warm to drink; no tea, no coffee. In making an inventory of the supplies left, the doctor found two hundred pounds of pemmican gone, and a hundred and fifty pounds of biscuit; if their journey continued they would have to subsist on half-rations.</p>
			<p>They then began to discuss what should be done, whether they should return to the ship and start out again. But how could they make up their minds to lose the hundred and fifty miles they had already made? To return without fuel would have a depressing effect upon the spirits of the crew. Could men be found again to resume their march across the ice?</p>
			<p>Evidently it was better to push on, even at the risk of severe privations.</p>
			<p>The doctor, Hatteras, and Bell were of this opinion; Simpson wanted to go back; the fatigue of the journey had worn upon his health; he was visibly weaker; but finding himself alone of this opinion, he resumed his place at the head of the sledge, and the little caravan continued its journey to the south.</p>
			<p>During the three next days, from the 15th to the 17th of January, all the monotonous incidents of the voyage were repeated; they advanced more slowly, and with much fatigue; their legs grew tired; the dogs dragged the sledge with difficulty; their diminished supply of food could not comfort men or beasts. The weather was very variable, changing from intense, dry cold to damp, penetrating mists.</p>
			<p>January 18th the aspect of the ice-fields changed suddenly; a great number of peaks, like sharp-pointed pyramids, and very high, appeared at the horizon; the ground in certain places came through the snow; it seemed formed of gneiss, schist, and quartz, with some appearance of limestone. The travellers at last touched earth again, and this land they judged to be that called North Cornwall.</p>
			<p>The doctor could not help striking the earth with joy; they had now only a hundred miles to go before reaching Cape Belcher, but their fatigue increased strangely on this soil, covered with sharp rocks, and interspersed with dangerous points, crevasses, and precipices; they had to go down into the depths of these abysses, climb steep ascents, and cross narrow gorges, in which the snow was drifted to the depth of thirty or forty feet.</p>

			<p>The travellers soon regretted the almost easy journey over the ice-fields, which so well suited the sledge; now it had to be dragged by main force; the weary dogs were insufficient; the men, compelled to take their place alongside of them, wore themselves out with hauling; often they had to take off the whole load to get over some steep hills; a place only ten feet wide often kept them busy for hours; so in this first day they made only five miles in North Cornwall, which is certainly well named, for it exhibits all the roughness, the sharp points, the steep gorges, the confused rockiness, of the southwest coast of England.</p>
			<p>The next day the sledge reached the top of the hills near the shore; the exhausted travellers, being unable to make a snow-hut, were obliged to pass the night under the tent, wrapped up in buffalo-skins, and drying their wet stockings by placing them about their bodies. The inevitable consequences of such conduct are easily comprehended; that night the thermometer fell below −44°, and the mercury froze.</p>
			<p>Simpson’s health caused great anxiety; a persistent cough, violent rheumatism, and intolerable pain obliged him to lie on the sledge which he could no longer guide. Bell took his place; he too was suffering, but not so much as to be incapacitated. The doctor also felt the consequences of this trip in this terrible weather; but he uttered no complaint; he walked on, resting on his staff; he made out the way and helped every one. Hatteras, impassible, and as strong as on the first day, followed the sledge in silence.</p>
			<p>January 20th the weather was so severe that the slightest effort produced complete prostration. Still, the difficulties of the way were so great, that Hatteras, the doctor, and Bell harnessed themselves with the dogs; sudden shocks had broken the front of the sledge, and they had to stop to repair it. Such delays were frequent every day.</p>
			<p>The travellers followed a deep ravine, up to their waists in snow, and perspiring violently in spite of the intense cold. They did not say a word. Suddenly Bell, who was near the doctor, looked at him with some alarm; then, without uttering a word, he picked up a handful of snow and began rubbing his companion’s face violently.</p>

			<p>“Well, Bell!” said the doctor, resisting.</p>
			<p>But Bell continued rubbing.</p>
			<p>“Come, Bell,” began the doctor again, his mouth, nose, and eyes full of snow, “are you mad? What’s the matter?”</p>
			<p>“If you have a nose left,” answered Bell, “you ought to be grateful to me.”</p>
			<p>“A nose!” answered the doctor, quickly, clapping his hand to his face.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Doctor, you were frost-bitten; your nose was white when I looked at you, and if I had not done as I did, you would have lost that ornament which is in the way on a journey, but agreeable to one’s existence.”</p>
			<p>In fact, the doctor’s nose was almost frozen; the circulation of the blood was restored in time, and, thanks to Bell, all danger was gone.</p>
			<p>“Thanks, Bell!” said the doctor; “I’ll be even with you yet.”</p>
			<p>“I hope so, Doctor,” the carpenter answered; “and may Heaven protect us from worse misfortunes!”</p>
			<p>“Alas, Bell,” continued the doctor, “you mean Simpson! The poor fellow is suffering terribly.”</p>
			<p>“Do you fear for his life?” asked Hatteras, quickly.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Captain,” answered the doctor.</p>
			<p>“And why?”</p>
			<p>“He has a violent attack of scurvy; his legs have begun to swell, and his gums too; the poor fellow lies half frozen on the sledge, and every movement redoubles his suffering. I pity him, Hatteras, and I can’t do anything to relieve him.”</p>
			<p>“Poor Simpson!” murmured Bell.</p>
			<p>“Perhaps we shall have to halt for a day or two,” resumed the doctor.</p>
			<p>“Halt!” shouted Hatteras, “when the lives of eighteen men are hanging on our return!”</p>
			<p>“Still⁠—” said the doctor.</p>
			<p>“Clawbonny, Bell, listen to me,” said Hatteras; “we have food for only twenty days! Judge for yourselves whether we can stop for a moment!”</p>
			<p>Neither the doctor nor Bell made any reply, and the sledge resumed its progress, which had been delayed for a moment. That evening they stopped beneath a hillock of ice, in which Bell at once cut a cavern; the travellers entered it; the doctor passed the night attending to Simpson; the scurvy had already made fearful ravages, and his sufferings caused perpetual laments to issue from his swollen lips.</p>
			<p>“Ah, Dr. Clawbonny!”</p>
			<p>“Courage, my dear fellow!” said the doctor.</p>
			<p>“I shall never get well! I feel it! I’d rather die!”</p>
			<p>The doctor answered these despairing words by incessant cares; although worn out by the fatigue of the day, he spent the night in composing a soothing potion for his patient; but the lime-juice was ineffectual, and continual friction could not keep down the progress of the scurvy.</p>

			<p>The next day he had to be placed again upon the sledge, although he besought them to leave him behind to die in peace; then they resumed their dreary and difficult march.</p>
			<p>The frozen mists penetrated the three men to the bone; the snow and sleet dashed against them; they were working like draught-horses, and with a scanty supply of food.</p>
			<p>Duke, like his master, kept coming and going, enduring every fatigue, always alert, finding out by himself the best path; they had perfect confidence in his wonderful instinct.</p>
			<p>During the morning of January 23d, amid almost total darkness, for the moon was new, Duke had run on ahead; for many hours he was not seen; Hatteras became uneasy, especially because there were many traces of bears to be seen; he was uncertain what to do, when suddenly a loud barking was heard.</p>
			<p>Hatteras urged on the sledge, and soon he found the faithful animal at the bottom of a ravine. Duke stood as motionless as if turned to stone, barking before a sort of cairn made of pieces of limestone, covered with a cement of ice.</p>
			<p>“This time,” said the doctor, detaching his harness, “it’s a cairn, there’s no doubt of that.”</p>
			<p>“What’s that to us?” asked Hatteras.</p>
			<p>“Hatteras, if it is a cairn, it may contain some document of value for us; perhaps some provisions, and it would be worth while to see.”</p>
			<p>“What European could have come as far as this?” asked Hatteras, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
			<p>“But in lack of Europeans,” answered the doctor, “cannot Esquimaux have made it here to contain what they have fished or shot? It’s their habit, I think.”</p>
			<p>“Well, go and look at it,” continued Hatteras; “but I’m afraid it will be hardly worth your while.”</p>
			<p>Clawbonny and Bell walked to the cairn with picks in their hands. Duke continued barking furiously. The limestones were firmly fastened together by the ice; but a few blows scattered them on the ground.</p>
			<p>“There’s something there, evidently,” said the doctor.</p>
			<p>“I think so,” answered Bell.</p>
			<p>They rapidly destroyed the cairn. Soon they found a bundle and in it a damp paper. The doctor took it with a beating heart. Hatteras ran forward, seized the paper, and read:⁠—</p>
			<p>“Altam⁠ ⁠… , <i>Porpoise</i>, December 13, 1860, longitude 12..°, latitude 8..° 35’.”</p>
			<p>“The <i>Porpoise?</i>” said the doctor.</p>
			<p>“The <i>Porpoise!</i>” replied Hatteras. “I never heard of a ship of this name in these seas.”</p>
			<p>“It is clear,” resumed the doctor, “that travellers, perhaps shipwrecked sailors, have been here within two months.”</p>
			<p>“That is sure,” said Bell.</p>
			<p>“What are we going to do?” asked the doctor.</p>
			<p>“Push on,” answered Hatteras, coldly. “I don’t know anything about any ship called the <i>Porpoise</i>, but I know that the brig <i>Forward</i> is waiting for our return.”</p>
